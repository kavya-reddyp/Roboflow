# Roboflow
Data Annotation using Roboflow (Object Detection Project).
The aim of this project is to perform object detection on license plates using the Roboflow platform.
Data Gathering:
•	Collected images of cars, both with and without defects, from various sources (internet, personal photos, dedicated cameras).
•	Ensured data diversity by capturing images with varying angles, lighting conditions, and backgrounds.
•	Collected a substantial dataset (hundreds or thousands of images) for optimal model training.
Roboflow Workflow:
•	Created a new project on the Roboflow platform and selected "Object Detection" as the project type.
•	Uploaded all collected images to the project.
Data Annotation:
•	Utilized Roboflow's annotation tools to meticulously draw bounding boxes around each number plates in the images.
•	Drawn the bounding box as tightly as possible around the number plate. Avoid excessive padding.
•	Ensured the corners of the bounding box align accurately with the edges of the number plate. Avoid skewed or uneven boxes.
•	Maintained consistent annotation styles throughout the dataset.
•	Maintained high-quality and consistent annotations throughout the dataset.
Dataset Versioning:
•	Created versions within Roboflow to track changes, revert to previous states, and isolate different data processing steps.
Data Splitting and Augmentation:
•	Divided the dataset into training (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) sets.
•	Enhanced the dataset through data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, rotation, and brightness/contrast adjustments.
Downloading the Dataset:
•	Exported the prepared dataset in the YOLOv9 format, resulting in a ZIP file containing: 
	Original images.
	Test, train and validated data set.
	Annotation files (.txt) with bounding box coordinates and class labels in YOLOv9 format.
Model Training and Evaluation (Beyond Roboflow):
•	Train the model using the exported YOLOv9 dataset and a choose any deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
•	Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test set using metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP).
Key Considerations:
•	Data Quality: The accuracy and diversity of the annotated dataset significantly impact model performance.
•	Computational Resources: Training deep learning models can be computationally intensive.
